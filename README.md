# Overview

This was made as a love letter to Cube Cavern as a whole (and as a fuck you to the Roblox Engine).

I don't have much to say, the project is what it says on the tin.

Do note: This is NOT made as a 1:1 recreation of Cube Cavern. There are SEVERAL innacuracies, these are mostly caused due to the original Cube Cavern being REALLY poorly made, 
which meant a lot of things (like the hotbar GUI) needed to be entirely replaced as it'd be too much work to make 1:1.
